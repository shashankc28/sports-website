								<p class="sed">Swimming is an individual or team sport that involves using arms and legs to move the body through water. Typically, the sport takes place in pools or in open-water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, swimmers also take part in relays. Swimming each stroke requires specific techniques, and in competition, there are specific regulations concerning the acceptable form for different strokes. There are also rules put in place to regulate what types of swimsuits are allowed at competitions. Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport. </p>

Wait, who? An injury kept him from competing in the World Championships. Otherwise, everyone might know his name by now. He could have won two or three gold medals and definitely four medals in total had he been healthy in Kazan. But the 21-year-old will have to wait until next year to show the world what he can do. He also could be one of the busiest swimmers at the Olympics as he is also a good backstroker. Whether you think he should be ranked ahead of Phelps is your opinion, but one thing is certain: this could be the next Phelps when the real one is all done with the sport of swimming.</p>

Le Clos is one of the best racers in the world. I cannot wait to watch him, Phelps and Cseh go at it in Rio. He sparked a little controversy after he talked trash to Phelps after Le Clos won the 100 fly gold in Kazan. But regardless, he is a great competitor and he is definitely a favorite to repeat gold in Rio in the 200 as well as challenge in the 100 fly and 200 free.</p>

The greatest swimmer of all time had a roaring 2015 with three number one ranked times. He will, once again, be the swimmer to watch in Rio as this could actually be his last meet ever. He already has more medals than anyone ever and he still has three world records, so Phelps is essentially swimming for the joy of it, which could be game over for the rest of the world. </p>

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p class="sed">
				Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found, with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC, with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible, Beowulf, the Quran and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a German professor of languages, wrote the first swimming book, The Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming (Der Schwimmer oder ein Zweigespräch über die Schwimmkunst).</p><p>

Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around London. The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association, was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country.</p><p>


The routes taken by Webb and T.W. Burgess across the English Channel, in 1875 and 1911, respectively.
In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a European audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873, winning a local competition in England. His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today.</p><p>

Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. Using the breaststroke technique, he swam the channel 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and 45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until T.W. Burgess made the crossing in 1911.</p><p>

Other European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896. The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892.</p><p>

Men's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. In 1902, the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced the front crawl to the Western world. In 1908, the world swimming association, Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), was formed. Women's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912; the first international tournament for women outside the Olympics was the 1922 Women's Olympiad. Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke, until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952.
